# MQTT client sample code in JavaScript

The sample code establishes a secure MQTT session with ARTIK Cloud, sends one message, and ends the session.

## Prerequisites
  - node
  - npm 

## Setup / Installation:
 1. Sign into [My ARTIK Cloud](https://artik.cloud/)
 2. On the device dashboard, click to connect a new device. Select the Demo Fire Sensor (from cloud.artik.sample.demofiresensor) and name your sensor SampleFireSensor (or any name you'd like).
 3. Click the Settings icon on the device you just added. Get the **device ID** and **device token**. If the token does not already exist, click "GENERATE DEVICE TOKENâ€¦" to get one.
 4. Run the command to install packages:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

 5. Prepare source files. Rename **template_config.json** to **config.json**. Then copy the device ID and device token obtained before to config.json file.

## Run the application
%> node app.js

Here is the sample response:
```text
publishing data: {"temp":214}
publish path: /v1.1/messages/<redacted>
